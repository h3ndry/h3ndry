### About Me

Softwares has become integrated into all parts of our lives, and I am obsessed
with user experience and minimalistic software. I like the UNIX philosophy that
states each program should do one thing and do it well. I try to keep that in
mind when I develop software.

I spent a large part of my day writing code, reading documentation, and
configuring my dotfiles. I am very proud to be part of the Neovim open source
community. It has enabled me to learn
more about the great features that Neovim provides to developers, and in doing
so, it has made me a better developer.

Right now, I am all about Linux, Front-End Development, and cloud computing.
Like other Linux enthusiasts, I often spent hours configuring arch Linux,
writing scripts to automate some of the tasks, and for the part I enjoy the
most, configuring Neovim to improve my development flow. When I started using
Neovim, I swear it was like I discovered a secret formula. Finally, I can focus
more on the code and functionality than fighting with the IDE to do a simple
thing.

### Outside of work

Outside of work, I enjoy watching TedTalk, science fiction movies, and
cartoons. I am a proud South African! I like working with brilliant, driven,
creative, and destructive people who want to do more than talk about change.
